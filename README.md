# VSCode SFML Template

This is the Visual Studio Code template that I use. Most of it was made using this tutorial:
[How To Use SFML With C++ And VSCode by Barji 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYspMwzV8w)
with some edits such as setting up a keybind for building the program and some changes to the project setup.

For this to work you need to download MinGW and C++ Extension pack in VSCode. Optionally to use the keybind you'll need to install the Command Runner Extension in VSCode.

How to use the custom keybinds:

Now use the command mingw32-make in terminal or if you have setup the keybind use F9 to build the main.exe inside the build folder and then just run it!
